tasks:
- zoom UI buttons
- auto balance thread seems still bad. 
    - because of speed changes. Both try to adjust to destired frame rate

- put chunks and areas to idle if no citizen how can work in it
- lost player. scorlling away to far makes it impossible to find back
- copy/paste left click change when moving not unselecting
- visualize when game might crash based on "out of memory"
    - or check out save game progress as i could save idle chunks and clean up from memory

- limit citizen hunger, currently infite negative
- improve chunk area assignment based on citizen count?
- bug: copy paste big area crash



- bug: deleting can crash game
    - integer overflow, D:\mein\github_gamedev\Zig_ChatSim\src\citizen.zig:356:31: 0x7ff7f71f682c in buildingFinished (zig.exe.obj),  building.woodRequired -= 1;
- delete test branches?


- features:
    - save game progress?
    - bugfixing/testing
    - put on steam

  
Some data:
- FPS: 144, citizens: 32183, gameTime: 330000, end FPS: 88.02314 (28.05.2025)
- ~102_000 citizen my cpu can not keep 60fps anymore(while streamng + debug mode)


- FPS: 90, citizens: 71574, gameTime: 400000, end FPS: 66.83762 (bigger test case)
- FPS: 92, citizens: 71671, gameTime: 400000, end FPS: 67.82236 (min distance reduced to 9)

Goal:
- a game which should not take more than 6month to make. Maybe publish to steam.
- performance should matter
- game idea:
    - city builder extreme fast
    - i have citizens. Each citizen just needs a home and food
        - citizens can be chatters
    - i as the player can:
        - place building orders: 
            - houses for citizens to live in
            - tree farm: citizens can become lumberjacks to gather wood and cut it. Required for building houses
            - farm: citizens can become farmers to plant food. Required for not starving
            - citizens must build these and gather resources for it
            - storage area. Used for storing food and wood
            - upgrade building:
                - bigger house: more people can live in it
    - citizens will automatically join if houses with space exit
    - game start with one small house and one citizen (the player) and storage area with some food and wood
    - game loop:
        - build more houses -> get more citizens
        - more citizen need more food -> build more or bigger farms
        - more citizens -> can build more faster
        - scale town up to what the PC can handle
            -> code performance matters
            -> expectations with my pc: 10_000 citizens and 60fp should be easy
                -> expectations which i guess should be possible: 100_000 citizens and 60fps
