open problems for changing to Zig:
    - continue with: unsure, maybe x11 with openGL or back to sdl
    - try without 3rd libraries to get better understanding
        - so no sdl3
        - will mean it only runs on one OS?

    - web assembly?
    - sdl3 
        - need to find some help documentation which i can use
            -https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL3/FrontPage
        - get some better understanding of what it can do
            -continue here: https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php
            -unsure if helpful: https://examples.libsdl.org/SDL3/
        - find out if i can do all the stuff i want with my game    
            - rotation/translation
                - paint one citizen based on many images
                    - just find out how it works. Not need to do the entrire citizens yet
            - zoom in/out
            - limit fps. check how i can integrate ticking and painting 
                - paint FPS as text to screen
                    - measure text
            - check some performance of 10000 citizens painted
        - check out "Signed Distance Fields (SDF Fonts)"
            - for drawing text which can be scalled

    - can i see cache misses with Zig? what performance metrics can i get?
    - how to use multi core. Build some code to see
    - twitch chat integration

    - go over entire Zig docu to see if there is some new unknown coding stuff
