tasks:
- real time code measurements
- check code for performance improvement for single cpu and no simd
    - citizen tick could be changed to a queue which know which citizen to tick when

- bug: lost citizen. Was caryying wood. Not moving at all. Far away from home
    - unknown how to reproduce and if would still happen

- features:
    - performance            
        - check code for performance improvement for single cpu and simd
        - check code for performance improvement for multiple cpu cores
        - performance of hashMap varies a lot. at some points goes below 30 fps and at other cpu is only at 17%
    - save game progress?
    - put on steam

- lean more vulkan?
    - go over docu? https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/index.html
        - this docu somehow hard do understand for me. Unsure in what cases it helps or if i need more knowledge first
  
Some data:
- FPS: 109, citizens: 23646, gameTime: 305056, end FPS: 58.177357 (12.05.2025)
- ~50_000 citizen my cpu can not keep 60fps anymore(while streamng + debug mode)
- FPS: 105, citizens: 23760, gameTime: 301152, end FPS: 55.984253 (fixed citizen not working when hungry and no food available)
- FPS: 103, citizens: 23239, gameTime: 299008, end FPS: 55.353718 (with deactivated code time measurment)

Goal:
- a game which should not take more than 6month to make. Maybe publish to steam.
- performance should matter
- game idea:
    - city builder extreme fast
    - i have citizens. Each citizen just needs a home and food
        - citizens can be chatters
    - i as the player can:
        - place building orders: 
            - houses for citizens to live in
            - tree farm: citizens can become lumberjacks to gather wood and cut it. Required for building houses
            - farm: citizens can become farmers to plant food. Required for not starving
            - citizens must build these and gather resources for it
            - storage area. Used for storing food and wood
            - upgrade building:
                - bigger house: more people can live in it
    - citizens will automatically join if houses with space exit
    - game start with one small house and one citizen (the player) and storage area with some food and wood
    - game loop:
        - build more houses -> get more citizens
        - more citizen need more food -> build more or bigger farms
        - more citizens -> can build more faster
        - scale town up to what the PC can handle
            -> code performance matters
            -> expectations with my pc: 10_000 citizens and 60fp should be easy
                -> expectations which i guess should be possible: 100_000 citizens and 60fps
