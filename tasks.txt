tasks:
- map limits can be reached. how to handle not to break
    - prevent player from going to far
    - what is my estimated max citizen count


- bug: path flickering if painting
- bug: first test can have memory leaks

- check steam achivements
- play test with big buildings more
    - might be some "ensureUnusedCapacity" crash possible, but very unlikely i think

- what if game crashes on load, before player can restart?
- think about what to do with test f-keys
- check performance for chunks in chunkAreas
    - can improve by not always searching area again and just chunk
- problem: 600_000 citizens test missed ~8 citizens indicating area can go to sleep to soon?
- check unload/save logic to be on other thread
- delete test branches?
- change to new git repo, remo
- check background music?

- features:
    - bugfixing/testing
    - put on steam

Offstream:
    - check steam achivements if doable on stream
    - test linux build
    - do i know someone for a mac build test?
  
Some data:
- FPS: 114, citizens: 32390, gameTime: 330000, end FPS: 80.47685 (19.06.2025)
- ~85_000 citizen my cpu can not keep 60fps anymore(while streamng + debug mode)
