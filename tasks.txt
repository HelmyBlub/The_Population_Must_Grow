tasks:
- increase complex citizen paint distance
- problem: 600_000 citizens test missed ~8 citizens indicating area can go to sleep to soon?
- test 600_000 citizens with quitting and starting game. Everything should still work
- check unload/save logic to not be in tick

- problem: load chunkArea but bighouse from other chunkArea could block some tiles
- bug: not all chunks ticked. Not all buildings where being build
- bug: bighouse over work order normal house
- check process RAM usage. Was using 1GB after scolling thorugh a lot of areas, but should not have been so much?
    - where could the data be?
- check performance for chunks in chunkAreas
    - can improve by not always searching area again and just chunk
- save on crash/panic?
- bug: ghost sounds after restart

- on game load with many citizens don't show "surpassed citizen count" message
- UI: reset 
- UI: sound volume setting
- check: make map round?
    - or check if limit to break game can be reached in reasonable time

- think about: save if citizens was starved?
- path paint optimization by again counting path tiles before as i count regardless

- small changes:
    - idle citizens walk slower
- check "ensureUnusedCapacity" values

- limit citizen hunger, currently infite negative
- bug: copy paste big area crash
- delete test branches?
- change to new git repo, remo

- features:
    - bugfixing/testing
    - put on steam

  
Some data:
- FPS: 111, citizens: 31580, gameTime: 330000, end FPS: 72.19633 (16.06.2025)
- ~85_000 citizen my cpu can not keep 60fps anymore(while streamng + debug mode)


Goal:
- a game which should not take more than 6month to make. Maybe publish to steam.
- performance should matter
- game idea:
    - city builder extreme fast
    - i have citizens. Each citizen just needs a home and food
        - citizens can be chatters
    - i as the player can:
        - place building orders: 
            - houses for citizens to live in
            - tree farm: citizens can become lumberjacks to gather wood and cut it. Required for building houses
            - farm: citizens can become farmers to plant food. Required for not starving
            - citizens must build these and gather resources for it
            - storage area. Used for storing food and wood
            - upgrade building:
                - bigger house: more people can live in it
    - citizens will automatically join if houses with space exit
    - game start with one small house and one citizen (the player) and storage area with some food and wood
    - game loop:
        - build more houses -> get more citizens
        - more citizen need more food -> build more or bigger farms
        - more citizens -> can build more faster
        - scale town up to what the PC can handle
            -> code performance matters
            -> expectations with my pc: 10_000 citizens and 60fp should be easy
                -> expectations which i guess should be possible: 100_000 citizens and 60fps
