tasks:
- bug: load of game panics
    - i build a big building on the top left edge of area. Probably the reason of crash?
        - also placed some potato field build orders, but should not be the case
- UX:   
    - double UI Size
- check steam achivements
    - test icon created. Can do others in the same way
    - how to with zig. A way that could work but not that great: https://zig.news/chapliboy/implementing-steamworks-api-in-zig-5dj3
- advertise my steam link somewhere on my twitch https://store.steampowered.com/app/3820960/The_Population_Must_Grow/?


- play test with big buildings more
    - might be some "ensureUnusedCapacity" crash possible, but very unlikely i think

- check performance for chunks in chunkAreas
    - can improve by not always searching area again and just chunk
- problem: 600_000 citizens test missed ~8 citizens indicating area can go to sleep to soon?
- check unload/save logic to be on other thread
- delete test branches?
- change to new git repo, remo
