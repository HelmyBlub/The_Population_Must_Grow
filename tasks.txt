- copy paste stick key

- bug: restart does not tick spawn chunk

- look into parallel stuff again
    - @cmpxchgStrong(comptime T: type, ptr: *T, expected_value: T, new_value: T, success_order: AtomicOrder, fail_order: AtomicOrder)


- final build to steam
    - validation layer where active on last build

- zig debugging with windows


- check performance for chunks in chunkAreas
    - can improve by not always searching area again and just chunk
- problem: 600_000 citizens test missed ~8 citizens indicating area can go to sleep to soon?
    - i think it happens when an chunk area goes to sleep in one tick, when one other chunkarea set an ealier chunkarea back to working, but if the chunk goes to sleep in the same tick it will be lost
        - could try to let the changing chunk be flag not idle for one more tick
- check unload/save logic to be on other thread
- delete test branches?
- change to new git repo, remo
