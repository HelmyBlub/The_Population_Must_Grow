tasks:
- continue: paintVulkan with citizen data: i see just black, where are the dogs?
- lean more vulkan?
    - go over docu? https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/index.html
        - try out geometry shader to get one input point which is citizen position to  generate output 2 triangles as a square to paint to
            - some cpp code doing geometry shader https://github.com/SaschaWillems/Vulkan/blob/master/examples/geometryshader/geometryshader.cpp
            - goal is to reduce data sent to graphics card and hope it will positivly improve performance
- clean up code to now use vulkan for graphics
    - how to split up vulkan code?
        - get some game data into vulkan and take this required code out
            - citizen data
                - paint citizen at correct location
                    - first use cpu to create triangle, later to geometry shader
                        - try difference between two trinalges or one big triangle to fit the image
                        - try geometry shader
- have some basic input handling
  
Goal:
- a game which should not take more than 6month to make. Maybe publish to steam.
- performance should matter
- game idea:
    - city builder extreme
    - i have citizens. Each citizen just needs a home and food
        - citizens can be chatters
    - i as the player can:
        - place building orders: 
            - houses for citizens to live in
            - sawmill: citizens can become lumberjacks to gather wood and cut it. Required for building houses
            - farm: citizens can become farmers to plant food. Required for not starving
            - citizens must build these and gather resources for it
            - storage area. Used for storing food and wood
            - upgrade building:
                - bigger house: more people can live in it
    - citizens will automatically join if houses with space exit
    - game start with one small house and one citizen (the player) and storage area with some food and wood
    - game loop:
        - build more houses -> get more citizens
        - more citizen need more food -> build more or bigger farms
        - more citizens -> can build more faster
        - scale town up to what the PC can handle
            -> code performance matters
            -> expectations with my pc: 10_000 citizens and 60fp should be easy
                -> expectations which i guess should be possible: 100_000 citizens and 60fps
