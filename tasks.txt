tasks
- more stuff to console in debug build 
    - giving information what graphics card is selected and why and what score
    - around code of "pickPhysicalDevice" and "isDeviceSuitable"

- check if i find anything to my game


- i had an endless loop on copy paste
    - was in releaseFast build, copied with ctrl. 
- crash on:
    thread 9372 panic: integer part of floating point value out of bounds
    D:\mein\github_gamedev\Zig_ChatSim\src\vulkan\fontVulkan.zig:122:38: 0x7ff71ce3b956 in displayPerformanceDebugInfo (thePopulationMustGrow.exe.obj)
            _ = try paintNumber(@as(u32, @intFromFloat(state.tickDurationSmoothedMircoSeconds)), .{ .x = -0.99 + tickDurationTextWidth, .y = offsetY }, performanceFontSize, &state.vkState.font.vkFont);

thinking what i expect on steam:
    - goal of 10 reviews (5 review after 3days)
    - after a week. See what steam statistics say about my game

Next project ideas:
- i want to try out shaders to make something look "better"
    - one simpler game where i can use most time on shaders and trying around with them
- simple game ideas:
    - speed dog ninja 
        - when players draws blade, time stops
        - has puzzle/tetris like pieces to move
        - when killing enemy, move set refreshes
        - when not hitting enemy in x turns, time runs again
        - try to use shaders to make it look "better"


Offstream:
    - youtube video on weekend
        - show my game
            - what i used to build it
                - zig
                - vulkan
                - twitch
