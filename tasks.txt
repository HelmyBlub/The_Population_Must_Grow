tasks:
- check code for performance improvement for single cpu
    - paint stuff
        - tree
        - sprite data setup changes
            - simplfy and use memcpy on far zooms
            - for near zoom values i have to keep default
            - try the not counting before and use last frame values
        - citizens
        - potato
        - building
        - big building

- bug: deleting can crash game
    - integer overflow, D:\mein\github_gamedev\Zig_ChatSim\src\citizen.zig:356:31: 0x7ff7f71f682c in buildingFinished (zig.exe.obj),  building.woodRequired -= 1;
- delete test simd branch?


- features:
    - performance            
        - check code for performance improvement for multiple cpu cores
        - performance of hashMap varies a lot. at some points goes below 30 fps and at other cpu is only at 17%
        - arena allocator (buggy)?
    - save game progress?
    - put on steam

- lean more vulkan?
    - go over docu? https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/index.html
        - this docu somehow hard do understand for me. Unsure in what cases it helps or if i need more knowledge first
  
Some data:
- FPS: 146, citizens: 33786, gameTime: 340960, end FPS: 92.33889
- ~102_000 citizen my cpu can not keep 60fps anymore(while streamng + debug mode)
- FPS: 147, citizens: 33903, gameTime: 341456, end FPS: 91.86446 (tree code data change for memcpy)

- fps test case: normal test, on 25k citizens -> set speed to 1, show fps, zoom out max
  FPS: 155, citizens: 30901, gameTime: 329648, end FPS: 103.1204
  FPS: 156, citizens: 31011, gameTime: 330096, end FPS: 112.827225 (with path changed)
  FPS: 154, citizens: 30775, gameTime: 329184, end FPS: 115.54597 (with tree changed)

Goal:
- a game which should not take more than 6month to make. Maybe publish to steam.
- performance should matter
- game idea:
    - city builder extreme fast
    - i have citizens. Each citizen just needs a home and food
        - citizens can be chatters
    - i as the player can:
        - place building orders: 
            - houses for citizens to live in
            - tree farm: citizens can become lumberjacks to gather wood and cut it. Required for building houses
            - farm: citizens can become farmers to plant food. Required for not starving
            - citizens must build these and gather resources for it
            - storage area. Used for storing food and wood
            - upgrade building:
                - bigger house: more people can live in it
    - citizens will automatically join if houses with space exit
    - game start with one small house and one citizen (the player) and storage area with some food and wood
    - game loop:
        - build more houses -> get more citizens
        - more citizen need more food -> build more or bigger farms
        - more citizens -> can build more faster
        - scale town up to what the PC can handle
            -> code performance matters
            -> expectations with my pc: 10_000 citizens and 60fp should be easy
                -> expectations which i guess should be possible: 100_000 citizens and 60fps
