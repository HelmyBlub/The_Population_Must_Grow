tasks:
- new auto balance thread logic?
    - auto thread balance still feels bad.
    - next idea:
        - measure differnce between 1 and 2 thread
        - find good value for required citizen count per thread to change between 1 to 2 thread. Use this value for every other thread count
            - if performance does not improve assume other apps take cpu cores. Not usefull to use more. Try again some other time
        - code logic:
            - try first change from 1 thread to 2 threads on 30_000 citizens. Assume 100_000 or more per thread is always good enough
                - if performance better. Assume x citizens per thread required for performance gain
                - if performance worse and ticked citizens amount close to 30_000 increase citizens by 10_000
                - when 


- bug: lost citizen 
    - assumption when position values high -> f32 precision not good enough. Change to f64?




- put chunks and areas to idle if no citizen how can work in it
    - problem: if having a lot of build orders when no citizens around for longer time it will reduce performance. Especially with lots of build orders
- visualize when game might crash based on "out of memory"
    - or check out save game progress as i could save idle chunks and clean up from memory

- limit citizen hunger, currently infite negative
- bug: copy paste big area crash
- bug: moving around crash on 1.6 million citizens while zoomed out max on releaseFast build



- bug: deleting can crash game
    - integer overflow, D:\mein\github_gamedev\Zig_ChatSim\src\citizen.zig:356:31: 0x7ff7f71f682c in buildingFinished (zig.exe.obj),  building.woodRequired -= 1;
- delete test branches?


- features:
    - save game progress?
    - bugfixing/testing
    - put on steam

  
Some data:
- FPS: 144, citizens: 32183, gameTime: 330000, end FPS: 88.02314 (30.05.2025)
- ~102_000 citizen my cpu can not keep 60fps anymore(while streamng + debug mode)



Goal:
- a game which should not take more than 6month to make. Maybe publish to steam.
- performance should matter
- game idea:
    - city builder extreme fast
    - i have citizens. Each citizen just needs a home and food
        - citizens can be chatters
    - i as the player can:
        - place building orders: 
            - houses for citizens to live in
            - tree farm: citizens can become lumberjacks to gather wood and cut it. Required for building houses
            - farm: citizens can become farmers to plant food. Required for not starving
            - citizens must build these and gather resources for it
            - storage area. Used for storing food and wood
            - upgrade building:
                - bigger house: more people can live in it
    - citizens will automatically join if houses with space exit
    - game start with one small house and one citizen (the player) and storage area with some food and wood
    - game loop:
        - build more houses -> get more citizens
        - more citizen need more food -> build more or bigger farms
        - more citizens -> can build more faster
        - scale town up to what the PC can handle
            -> code performance matters
            -> expectations with my pc: 10_000 citizens and 60fp should be easy
                -> expectations which i guess should be possible: 100_000 citizens and 60fps
