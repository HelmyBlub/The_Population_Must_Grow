tasks
- endless loop on quit
    - on one more debug line on the wait
    - happen on linux with 1 citizen and alot of start and quitting after 1sec
    - game did not quit after 2.5h play, but did save, had 2 threads active
        - why?, how to reproduce? what could be the reason?
- final build to steam
    - validation layer where active on last build

- look into parallel stuff again
    - @cmpxchgStrong(comptime T: type, ptr: *T, expected_value: T, new_value: T, success_order: AtomicOrder, fail_order: AtomicOrder)



- check: unload waiting chunkAreas
    - still doable before release?
- check performance for chunks in chunkAreas
    - can improve by not always searching area again and just chunk
- problem: 600_000 citizens test missed ~8 citizens indicating area can go to sleep to soon?
    - i think it happens when an chunk area goes to sleep in one tick, when one other chunkarea set an ealier chunkarea back to working, but if the chunk goes to sleep in the same tick it will be lost
        - could try to let the changing chunk be flag not idle for one more tick
- check unload/save logic to be on other thread
- delete test branches?
- change to new git repo, remo

- features:
    - bugfixing/testing
    - put on steam

Offstream:
    - youtube video on weekend
    - look into parallel stuff again
        - @cmpxchgStrong(comptime T: type, ptr: *T, expected_value: T, new_value: T, success_order: AtomicOrder, fail_order: AtomicOrder)
    - check: steam emulation
    - ask friend for mac stuff, but probably not doing it
  
Some data:
- FPS: 115, citizens: 33597, gameTime: 330000, end FPS: 92.21098 (01.07.2025)
- ~85_000 citizen my cpu can not keep 60fps anymore(while streamng + debug mode)
