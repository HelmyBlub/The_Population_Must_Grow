tasks:
- walking pathes
    - check draw order so citizens are not insivible behind pathes
        - put potatofields also in these
    - buildings can only be placed connected to a path

    - citizens are not allowed to walk over buildings, which are not their own
        - pathfinding?
            - start with simple but inperformant version? like A*
            - dumb citizens, try to walk direct path and can only do simple adjustments

- features:
    - walking pathes?
        - put potato fields and pathes in own drawCmd as they should be painted first
        - buildings/homes only possible connected to pathes
        - citizens should prefer walking on path
        - to many citizens walking over a potato field changes it to path tile
        - what about trees?
            - citizens can walk towards trees not connected to pathes
        - what about potato fields?
            - citizens can walk over potato fields for food
    - change penalty for not enough food?
        - low on food => slower, less productive citizen, might not work most tasks, only does potato planting
    - day/night cycle? citizen go home to sleep at night?
    - paint order?
    - window resizing?
    - animations?
    - decoration?
    - UX?
    - sound?

- performance and multicore when all features implemented
- performance of hashMap varies a lot. at some points goes below 30 fps and at other cpu is only at 17%
- lean more vulkan?
    - go over docu? https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/index.html
        - this docu somehow hard do understand for me. Unsure in what cases it helps or if i need more knowledge first
  
Some data:
- 100_000 citizens in 253 seconds (10.04.2025)
- zig build test: FPS: 511 (10.04.2025)

Goal:
- a game which should not take more than 6month to make. Maybe publish to steam.
- performance should matter
- game idea:
    - city builder extreme fast
    - i have citizens. Each citizen just needs a home and food
        - citizens can be chatters
    - i as the player can:
        - place building orders: 
            - houses for citizens to live in
            - tree farm: citizens can become lumberjacks to gather wood and cut it. Required for building houses
            - farm: citizens can become farmers to plant food. Required for not starving
            - citizens must build these and gather resources for it
            - storage area. Used for storing food and wood
            - upgrade building:
                - bigger house: more people can live in it
    - citizens will automatically join if houses with space exit
    - game start with one small house and one citizen (the player) and storage area with some food and wood
    - game loop:
        - build more houses -> get more citizens
        - more citizen need more food -> build more or bigger farms
        - more citizens -> can build more faster
        - scale town up to what the PC can handle
            -> code performance matters
            -> expectations with my pc: 10_000 citizens and 60fp should be easy
                -> expectations which i guess should be possible: 100_000 citizens and 60fps
