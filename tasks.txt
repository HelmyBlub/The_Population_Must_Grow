tasks:
- what next?
    - select between two buildings: house and treefarm 
        - house -> more citizens
        - treefarm -> plants trees and cuts them down for wood
            - building select just by pressing key 1 or 2
            - cut down tree grows back slowly
            - tree only cut down when fully grown
            - when building placed, search free citizen based on distance to building
                - citizen then selects tree based on distance to him
    - make UI
        - rectangles to select which building to place
        - mass build option
            - click to drag rectangle for building in entire selected area
        - citizen counter
    - change:
        - problem: unclear why i can not plant more buildings
            - currently based on free citizens
            - change to no limit, but i have to remember which one need to be build

    - fix zig tests?
        - maybe they doe not fit my requirements?
            - can i console log or not?

- think about how to effectivly use multi core programming for main game logic
    - do not forget simd vector stuff
- get "zig build test" working
    - how could i see debug messages here?

- lean more vulkan?
    - go over docu? https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/index.html
        - this docu somehow hard do understand for me. Unsure in what cases it helps or if i need more knowledge first
- clean up code to now use vulkan for graphics
    - how to split up vulkan code?
        - get some game data into vulkan and take this required code out
  
Goal:
- a game which should not take more than 6month to make. Maybe publish to steam.
- performance should matter
- game idea:
    - city builder extreme
    - i have citizens. Each citizen just needs a home and food
        - citizens can be chatters
    - i as the player can:
        - place building orders: 
            - houses for citizens to live in
            - sawmill: citizens can become lumberjacks to gather wood and cut it. Required for building houses
            - farm: citizens can become farmers to plant food. Required for not starving
            - citizens must build these and gather resources for it
            - storage area. Used for storing food and wood
            - upgrade building:
                - bigger house: more people can live in it
    - citizens will automatically join if houses with space exit
    - game start with one small house and one citizen (the player) and storage area with some food and wood
    - game loop:
        - build more houses -> get more citizens
        - more citizen need more food -> build more or bigger farms
        - more citizens -> can build more faster
        - scale town up to what the PC can handle
            -> code performance matters
            -> expectations with my pc: 10_000 citizens and 60fp should be easy
                -> expectations which i guess should be possible: 100_000 citizens and 60fps
