tasks:
- continue: changing to use chunks, build working but lots of stuff to do
- infinite map
    - chunks
        - generate chunks when required
            - required when camera is over chunk
            - when citizens searches closest tree 
            - use perlin noise for tree placement
        - citizens in chunks
        - all logic needs to correctly iterate chunks
            - tick each tree, potato plant, citizens
            - when clicking, clicked into which chunk
            - painting, selecting all sprites to paint
    - open questions
        - 
        - citizens in chunk or not? yes
            - each citizens needs to tick
            - find citizens by proximity
            - if in chunks and moving, don't update twice

- features:
    - infinite map
        - grass tiles instead of black background
            - maybe just green rectangle per chunk
        - generate map where player looks
            - limit by some distance to existing citizens
                - should be allowed to build with distance to each other
                - but should not result in getting lost
        - tree do not regrow by themselves
            - without tree farm, citizens need to seach further and further
        - citizens have view distance, if no wood/tree in sight they need to randomly search
    - upgrade building:
        - house -> more citizens per house
        - tree farm -> more trees around tree farm
    - demolish buildings

    - walking pathes?
    - decoration?

- performance and multicore when all features implemented
- lean more vulkan?
    - go over docu? https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/index.html
        - this docu somehow hard do understand for me. Unsure in what cases it helps or if i need more knowledge first
  
Goal:
- a game which should not take more than 6month to make. Maybe publish to steam.
- performance should matter
- game idea:
    - city builder extreme fast
    - i have citizens. Each citizen just needs a home and food
        - citizens can be chatters
    - i as the player can:
        - place building orders: 
            - houses for citizens to live in
            - tree farm: citizens can become lumberjacks to gather wood and cut it. Required for building houses
            - farm: citizens can become farmers to plant food. Required for not starving
            - citizens must build these and gather resources for it
            - storage area. Used for storing food and wood
            - upgrade building:
                - bigger house: more people can live in it
    - citizens will automatically join if houses with space exit
    - game start with one small house and one citizen (the player) and storage area with some food and wood
    - game loop:
        - build more houses -> get more citizens
        - more citizen need more food -> build more or bigger farms
        - more citizens -> can build more faster
        - scale town up to what the PC can handle
            -> code performance matters
            -> expectations with my pc: 10_000 citizens and 60fp should be easy
                -> expectations which i guess should be possible: 100_000 citizens and 60fps
