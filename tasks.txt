tasks:
- new auto balance thread logic?
    - check if feels good while streaming
- bug: citizens very hungry not finishing building
    - did long thin horizontal build. Leftmost citizens had 3 very hungry ones, never finishing their building. How?
    - one chunkArea with active citizens eating from unactive chunk area all the time. But this only ticks every 16seconds so not enough food
- put chunks and areas to idle if no citizen who can work in it
    - problem: if having a lot of build orders when no citizens around for longer time it will reduce performance. Especially with lots of build orders
- save idle chunks and clean up from memory, load when required again

- limit citizen hunger, currently infite negative
- bug: copy paste big area crash
- bug: moving around crash on 1.6 million citizens while zoomed out max on releaseFast build



- bug: deleting can crash game
    - integer overflow, D:\mein\github_gamedev\Zig_ChatSim\src\citizen.zig:356:31: 0x7ff7f71f682c in buildingFinished (zig.exe.obj),  building.woodRequired -= 1;
- delete test branches?


- features:
    - save game progress?
    - bugfixing/testing
    - put on steam

  
Some data:
- FPS: 128, citizens: 34724, gameTime: 330000, end FPS: 76.96972 (02.06.2025)
- ~102_000 citizen my cpu can not keep 60fps anymore(while streamng + debug mode)


Goal:
- a game which should not take more than 6month to make. Maybe publish to steam.
- performance should matter
- game idea:
    - city builder extreme fast
    - i have citizens. Each citizen just needs a home and food
        - citizens can be chatters
    - i as the player can:
        - place building orders: 
            - houses for citizens to live in
            - tree farm: citizens can become lumberjacks to gather wood and cut it. Required for building houses
            - farm: citizens can become farmers to plant food. Required for not starving
            - citizens must build these and gather resources for it
            - storage area. Used for storing food and wood
            - upgrade building:
                - bigger house: more people can live in it
    - citizens will automatically join if houses with space exit
    - game start with one small house and one citizen (the player) and storage area with some food and wood
    - game loop:
        - build more houses -> get more citizens
        - more citizen need more food -> build more or bigger farms
        - more citizens -> can build more faster
        - scale town up to what the PC can handle
            -> code performance matters
            -> expectations with my pc: 10_000 citizens and 60fp should be easy
                -> expectations which i guess should be possible: 100_000 citizens and 60fps
