tasks:
- check: citizen stuck between big buildings with valid pathing

- check more with trapped citizens and big buildings
    - had some confused citizens not wanting to build big building once
    - had citizens walking over bigbuilding(probably was not finished building, but was not visible before when it was nearly finished)

- check steam achivements
    - setup steam side
        - estimated work amount 2h
    - check if works without steam
    - code:
        - set achievement
        - get achievement to check if already acquired
        - maybe storeStats so steam popup happens () is rate limited so call max once per minute
        - do callbacks matter? i did not register any one so i assume nothing should be done
        - should i store the ISteamUserStats ptr?

- play test with big buildings more
    - might be some "ensureUnusedCapacity" crash possible, but very unlikely i think
- bug: come chunks did not come to rest: i guess big building chunks


- check performance for chunks in chunkAreas
    - can improve by not always searching area again and just chunk
- problem: 600_000 citizens test missed ~8 citizens indicating area can go to sleep to soon?
- check unload/save logic to be on other thread
- delete test branches?
- change to new git repo, remo
- check background music?
- update readme

- features:
    - bugfixing/testing
    - put on steam

Offstream:
    - check steam achivements if doable on stream
    - test linux build
    - do i know someone for a mac build test?
  
Some data:
- FPS: 116, citizens: 32551, gameTime: 330000, end FPS: 85.395515 (25.06.2025)
- ~85_000 citizen my cpu can not keep 60fps anymore(while streamng + debug mode)
