tasks:
- check code for performance improvement for single cpu and no simd
    - change tree ticking:
        - tree know the time when they are starting to grow
        - after time is bigger than grow time -> set tree.grow = true
        - create: chunkQueue which should be sorted and be walked through in order

    - citizen tick could be changed to a queue which know which citizen to tick when

- bug: lost citizen. Was caryying wood. Not moving at all. Far away from home

- features:
    - performance            
        - check code for performance improvement for single cpu and simd
        - check code for performance improvement for multiple cpu cores
        - performance of hashMap varies a lot. at some points goes below 30 fps and at other cpu is only at 17%
    - save game progress?
    - put on steam

- lean more vulkan?
    - go over docu? https://docs.vulkan.org/spec/latest/index.html
        - this docu somehow hard do understand for me. Unsure in what cases it helps or if i need more knowledge first
  
Some data:
- FPS: 90, citizens: 13259, gameTime: 287072 (08.05.2025)
- FPS: 94, citizens: 13887, gameTime: 290736 (work in progress: chunk item queue for trees)

Goal:
- a game which should not take more than 6month to make. Maybe publish to steam.
- performance should matter
- game idea:
    - city builder extreme fast
    - i have citizens. Each citizen just needs a home and food
        - citizens can be chatters
    - i as the player can:
        - place building orders: 
            - houses for citizens to live in
            - tree farm: citizens can become lumberjacks to gather wood and cut it. Required for building houses
            - farm: citizens can become farmers to plant food. Required for not starving
            - citizens must build these and gather resources for it
            - storage area. Used for storing food and wood
            - upgrade building:
                - bigger house: more people can live in it
    - citizens will automatically join if houses with space exit
    - game start with one small house and one citizen (the player) and storage area with some food and wood
    - game loop:
        - build more houses -> get more citizens
        - more citizen need more food -> build more or bigger farms
        - more citizens -> can build more faster
        - scale town up to what the PC can handle
            -> code performance matters
            -> expectations with my pc: 10_000 citizens and 60fp should be easy
                -> expectations which i guess should be possible: 100_000 citizens and 60fps
