tasks:
- small changes:
    - idle citizens walk slower
    - less far away from home
- UI: reset 
- UI: sound volume setting
- save on crash/panic?
- property to disable vulkan debug layer
- check "ensureUnusedCapacity" values

- check: make map round?
    - or check if limit to break game can be reached in reasonable time
- check performance for chunks in chunkAreas
    - can improve by not always searching area again and just chunk



- problem: 600_000 citizens test missed ~8 citizens indicating area can go to sleep to soon?
- check unload/save logic to be on other thread
- limit citizen hunger, currently infite negative
- bug: copy paste big area crash
- delete test branches?
- change to new git repo, remo
- think about what to do with test f-keys

- features:
    - bugfixing/testing
    - put on steam

  
Some data:
- FPS: 113, citizens: 31580, gameTime: 330000, end FPS: 73.054474 (17.06.2025)
- ~85_000 citizen my cpu can not keep 60fps anymore(while streamng + debug mode)
- FPS: 116, citizens: 33251, gameTime: 330000, end FPS: 85.51717 (idle citizens walk slower)
- FPS: 116, citizens: 33234, gameTime: 330000, end FPS: 86.40941 (hungry citizens are fast when food found)
- FPS: 115, citizens: 34030, gameTime: 330000, end FPS: 80.7412 (citizens reset moveTo when they found food)
- FPS: 117, citizens: 33074, gameTime: 330000, end FPS: 84.82323 (citizens move random no longer based on graph top left)

Goal:
- a game which should not take more than 6month to make. Maybe publish to steam.
- performance should matter
- game idea:
    - city builder extreme fast
    - i have citizens. Each citizen just needs a home and food
        - citizens can be chatters
    - i as the player can:
        - place building orders: 
            - houses for citizens to live in
            - tree farm: citizens can become lumberjacks to gather wood and cut it. Required for building houses
            - farm: citizens can become farmers to plant food. Required for not starving
            - citizens must build these and gather resources for it
            - storage area. Used for storing food and wood
            - upgrade building:
                - bigger house: more people can live in it
    - citizens will automatically join if houses with space exit
    - game start with one small house and one citizen (the player) and storage area with some food and wood
    - game loop:
        - build more houses -> get more citizens
        - more citizen need more food -> build more or bigger farms
        - more citizens -> can build more faster
        - scale town up to what the PC can handle
            -> code performance matters
            -> expectations with my pc: 10_000 citizens and 60fp should be easy
                -> expectations which i guess should be possible: 100_000 citizens and 60fps
