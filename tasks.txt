tasks
- release on steam
    - continue: changing all setup functions to print out error code
    - print out graphics card name when physical device selected
    - first user game just crashes. How to handle user problems in easy way
        - best case: user sees an error message
        - sleep before stopping application, so user can see messages
    - print out error codes on failures

thinking what i expect on steam:
    - goal of 10 reviews
    - after a week. See what steam statistics say about my game

Next project ideas:
- i want to try out shaders to make something look "better"
    - one simpler game where i can use most time on shaders and trying around with them
- simple game ideas:
    - speed dog ninja 
        - when players draws blade, time stops
        - has puzzle/tetris like pieces to move
        - when killing enemy, move set refreshes
        - when not hitting enemy in x turns, time runs again
        - try to use shaders to make it look "better"
